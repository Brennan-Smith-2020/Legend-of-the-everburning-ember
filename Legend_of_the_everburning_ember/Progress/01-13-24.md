# TODO 01/13/24 4:25 PM

Add a function at end of title screen to make screen go black, than add scene from any imported file
buttons work just add and fix functionality for extra ones
fix it registering clicks multiple times
fix the background skipping around alot
license it soon


*Note*
    pygame.draw.rect(screen, ((0, 0, 0)), button2_rect)
    pygame.draw.rect(screen, ((0, 0, 0)), button3_rect) 
that block of code isnt needed, just use button2 and button3_rect to know where it is, only there so i know the coordinates of them (Also dont remove till they are all not needed)

*Note 2*
To fix the button registering alot put a time.sleep(0.1) or limit button presses over a span of 0.1 seconds, whatever works at that time

### 6:50 PM
Working on adding and implementing the main stage, will need a way to position tiles easier.
