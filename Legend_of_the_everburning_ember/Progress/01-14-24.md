# TODO 01/14/24 10:22 AM
Work on TODO of yesterday and also work on a new tile system (Current one does not work well)

## *Notes*
Fixed all buttons to have text, will need to make world select menu (Play will go to most recent save, load will go to any save selected.)
*1:49 PM* Fixed loop of background by cloning and cropping layers
*7:21 PM* Publishing to github, got world generation to work (Working on trees), thinking on replacing grass

## Also to anyone who made the assets used in-game I apologize if I didnt credit you
